This AutoHotkey script serves three main functions: 
* Correcting every typo you ever made to ensure near-perfect copywriting even during drafting phase.
* Expanding abbreviations and short-key-combinations for much faster typing (for example "eo" being expanded to "each other" and "fe" to "for example")
* Some extra functionality like Win+G selecting the last typed word and searching for it in Google. 

The idea here is to massively speed up writing, correct typos and save your fingers some strain. I have this file sitting in my autostart folder and mapped the otherwise useless capslock key to select the last typed word and open a popup to enter the correction. 

It might be useful for you to delete all my custom corrections and start building this script up with your own ones if you encounter any weird behavior, but I have not found any issues with the script. If you do simply delete everything after this:
